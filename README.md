# CLASSIFY-CLOTHES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

##Objective
### • To build Softmax Regression & Random Forest ensemble using scikit-learn for cloth classification in Fashion MNIST dataset

## Approach
### • Utilized k-fold Cross-Validation on Softmax-Regression and Random-Forest to select a model for fine-tuning using Grid Search
### • Leveraged PCA projection technique for dimensional reduction of the training dataset to optimize the Grid Search on a dataset

## Impact 
### • Assessed best model estimator on the reduced test dataset, by measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
